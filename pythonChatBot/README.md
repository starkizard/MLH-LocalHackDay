# Gritty-Chatbot

Kind of an arrogant chatbot

But what can we do?

requirements: chatbotAI, wikipedia
pip3 install them. 

This is a python chatbot, Part of the LHD weekend submissions, Wanted to make something different , so gave it a not so friendly personality. 

Useful thing that it can do:
who is / what is [thing] will return a wikipedia summary of [thing]

run :
``` python3 main.py ```
